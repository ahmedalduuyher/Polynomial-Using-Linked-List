This lab was for my COMPENG 2SI3 - Data Structures and Algorithms course where I created a program that does operations between monomials and polynomials using a sorted singly linked list with a dummy header. I have also written comments in the Poly.cpp file outlining the asymptotic run time and space complexity for each method implemented in the Poly class.
